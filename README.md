# Callbacks
Individually create your own JavaScript callback function example. Be ready to discuss what you wrote and teach back to your group. Use pseudocode so your group members can see your thought process.

Then you will work as a group to combine your code to create one final example. Asynchronous callback functions are a must! Each group member will take responsibility for one portion of the final example. Add CSS and style your final HTML page.
